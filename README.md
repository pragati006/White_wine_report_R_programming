# White_wine_report

The White wine data set contains information on almost 4900 thousand white wine samples across 12 attributes . I started by understanding the individual attributes in the data set, and then I explored interesting questions and leads as I continued to make observations on plots. Eventually, I explored the quality of white wine samples across many attributes and created a plots to predict the quality of white wine.

The exploration of white wine dataset shows that the quality of white wine is largly bases on the alcohol, residual sugar and chlorides content.High quality white wine samples have high alcohol content and low residual sugar and chlorides content.
